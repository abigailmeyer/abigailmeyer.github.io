    <h1>SUNSET</h1>
    <p>The sun represents eternal life, as well as the eternal light of heaven. When you think of it as a sunset, it symbolizes the end of our earthly life. This photo was taken in Brittany, France, I was very lucky to spend time in this wonderful place,
        but it was also one of the last trips my grandfather will have gotten to go on due to his current state. I hate to say it represents the sun going down, but we have to come to terms with things like this in life.
