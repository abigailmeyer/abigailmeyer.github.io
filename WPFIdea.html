    <h1>MY IDEA</h1>
    <p>For my final project, I would like to create an online resume for myself and employers. I have learned so much in this class so why not show it off by using the skills I learned to create a resume. This course has really allowed me to find other ways
        to be creative without having to know how to draw or use different adobe platforms. I’ve been meaning to make some sort of portfolio or resume and now is finally my chance to do that. I also want to create something that I can continue to work
        on and this is something that I will continue to work on. I am so excited to start this project. I plan to use JS to make an email feature because I’ve been wanting to do this for a while. I would like to create some sort of photo gallery on this
        website and I will probably use a grid or flex display for this. I really want to make this website scream me! </p>
