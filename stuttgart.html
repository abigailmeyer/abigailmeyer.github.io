    <h1>SCHLOSSPLATZ</h1>
    <p>A fountain represents a sacred opening, gap, or tunnel which is a connection to eternity itselfâ€”as well as to the depths of our own being. I don't really believe in a higher being but I do believe in some sort of afterlife. It seems that most major
        cities have some sort of fountain they are known for, this photo was taking while living in Stuttgart, Germany, while living here I was given a lot of freedom from my parents which allowed me to come to terms with myself on certain things, giving
        me some sort of purpose and finding my being.
