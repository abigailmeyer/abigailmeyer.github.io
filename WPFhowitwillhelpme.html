    <h1>HOW I WILL BENIFIT FROM IT</h1>
    <p>I am not the best at continuing something once Iâ€™ve started it. This is the only programming and web design class I have to take for my major but it is something I would like to continue doing and learning about! As I said in my last slide I think
        making this virtual resume will encourage me to keep working on my web design skills and I think it will be good to have when I start applying for jobs. </p>
