                <h2>Why Trader Joes are the Best Grocery Stores for College Students</h2>

                <p2>If we could shop at Whole Foods every day I’m sure we would. Whole Foods is great and all but why spend $150 at Whole Foods every week when you could be spending $50 at Trader Joes every week. In my freshman year of college when my parents
                    dropped me off at school we went to Whole Foods to stock up on some snacks for my dorm room, but because my parents were buying the price point didn’t really matter until I was the one paying for the snacks, which is when I realized
                    I really wasn’t getting that much bang for my buck. I’m sure all of you have heard of Trader Joes and probably shop there, but for those who have not, it will open so many doors for you. Trader Joes makes cooking fun and all of their
                    products are unique within themselves, on a good week I leave Trader Joes with protein, fruits, vegetables, and more only spending $50 or less they are also vegan friendly! The great thing about Trader Joes is that everything including
                    produce is priced the same all over the country. If you haven’t been to Trader Joes and are still shopping at Whole Foods please make the switch, you will thank me later. </p2>

                <h2>COFFEE SHOPS THAT WONT BREAK THE BANK</h2>
                <img src="maman.JPG" width="250px" height="220px" class="center">

                <br>
                <p2>A latte in New York City can range from $3.00 to $9.00, isn’t that ridiculous? Now, this is from personal experience as this is supposed to be a website from college students for college students. Lattes can get so expensive especially
                    if you’re ordering nut or oat milk, I guess trying to reduce your carbon footprint can be pretty expensive. To make life a little more inexpensive I’ve made a list below of coffee shops, both chains and individually owned that offer
                    student discounts and won’t burn a hole in your wallet.

                    <br>
                    <br> - Sumptown Coffee Roasters (no surcharge for soy or almond milk)
                    <br> - Birch Coffee (20% off with a student ID)
                    <br> - Pret A Manger (no surcharge for oat, almond, or soy milk)
                    <br> - Rex Coffee $4.50 for a latte
                    <br> - Fair Folks and a Goat offer a $35 monthly membership that is all you can drink coffee, tea, and lattes
                    <br>
                    <br> More shops will be added when discovered or sent in through our email feature at the bottom! The cheapest option for a latte will always be investing in a Nespresso Machine, they are always having good sales and if you add up
                    the amount of money you spend on coffee each month it will probably end up being the cost of a basic Nespresso Machine, so if you’re looking into saving money buying a Nespresso machine is always a good way to avoid spending money
                    on coffee every day.

                <h2>IF YOU'RE NOT SPLITTING YOU'RE NOT BENEFITING</h2>
                <br>
                <p2>I’m sure all of you know that splitting a meal can save you a lot of money but there are also some other benefits to splitting even if you’re not trying to save money. When you order an entree at a restaurant you are usually given two
                    servings of whatever you ordered, I’m sure some of you might know this already but splitting food can also be healthier for you sometimes. Splitting meals with someone also allows more room for dessert, and you don’t always have to
                    split between two people, another benefit of splitting and sharing is that everyone gets to have a different taste of the restaurant you’re eating at. I know this segment is short but I am just reassuring you that splitting food with
                    someone can benefit you in so many ways and maybe you can share this information with your friends!</p2>
