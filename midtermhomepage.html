            <h1>WHAT IS THE COLLEGE KITCHEN?</h1>
            <p>Hi! My name is Abigail Meyer and I am a Junior at Fordham University Lincoln Center. I started The College Kitchen to provide resources for college students on how to save money and utilize the resources in their dorm room for cooking. As
                a college freshman on a meal plan that really sucked I had to find ways to utilize my microwave, toaster, and coffee pot. Now that I have a full kitchen in my apartment I have realized how important it is to share how I used only a couple
                of kitchen appliances to make full course meals and snacks. I also want to provide cheaper options for grabbing a bite or grocery shopping to help you guys save money, I hope you find what youâ€™re looking for!</p>
