        <h1>The History behind Alex Madonna and the Madonna Inn</h1>
        <p>According to the New York Times, Alex Madonna was a businessman and real estate, developer. Although we may not think being s a real estate developer is being an artist. Real estate developers create developments from the ground up and these developments
            are architecture. The opening of the Madonna Inn took place in 1958 around Christmas time, at this time there were only 12 rooms built according to the Inns website, the people who had booked for the grand opening were given a complimentary
            nights stay. Since then the Madonna Inn now has one hundred and ten rooms total.
        </p>
        <p>Alex Madonna was not only the thoughts behind this amazing idea but also the architect. Alex Madonna did not hire an architect for this project of his. Alex wanted people to be happy and content when they stayed in a hotel, he wanted to give people
            more than the bare minimum unlike most hotels and inns. </p>
