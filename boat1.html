    <h1>BOATS</h1>
    <p>The boat represents a journey, a crossing, adventure, and exploration. My life has been a whirlwind in bith good and bad ways. I have moved 13 times and attended 11 different schools. I have constantly felt like I am on a boat throughout life, always
        crossing oceans, sometimes the ocean is bumpy and you dont know what the ocean has to provide but it will always end up giving you a new experience to continue your journy.</p>
