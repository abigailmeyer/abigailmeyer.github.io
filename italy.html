    <h1>THE OCEAN</h1>
    <p>The ocean symbolizes stability, something I havent always had. The ocean has been a calming place for me, I would'nt say it provides stability but it gives me comfort and is a place I feel strong. I have swam competitivly my whole life and the water
        has always been something constant in my life, I recently just got my scuba lisense and now have a different sense of the ocean now that I can breathe under the water with my certification. </p>
