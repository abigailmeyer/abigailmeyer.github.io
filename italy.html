    <h1>THE OCEAN</h1>
    <p>The ocean symbolizes stability, something I haven’t always had. The ocean has been a calming place for me, I wouldn’t say it provides stability but it gives me comfort and is a place I feel strong. I have swum competitively my whole life and the water
        has always been something constant in my life, I recently just got my scuba license and now have a different sense of the ocean now that I can breathe under the water with my certification.</p>
