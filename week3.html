<p>I really enjoyed reading this "comic book", Scott McCloud has a lot of interesting ways of looking at different mediums. I enjoyed this comic because he spoke about different mediums but also different mediums within comic books. I also really enjoyed
    the art in this reading. In chapter two McCloud talks about ICONS, this seemed more psychological than anything to me. An icon is something used to represent a person, place, or thing. I never have really thought about this idea until reading this
    comic. There are so many icons for so many different things, I mean letters are icons, isn't that crazy? McCloud does a really good job of going into all the bits and pieces of how comic books are curated. Having no prior knowledge of comic books
    this really interested me. Comic books are so much more than words and pictures in a book but more so a form of art. Comic books are abstract in many ways, as he talks about in chapter two titles Vocabulary. Comic books make reading so much more interesting.

<p>Previously I mentioned that I felt like McCloud made some parts of his chapter very psychological and questionable, the image above explains my reasoning for thinking this. McCloud says our faces are masks that we are born with, facing outward, super
    weird to me but very true. When you wear a mask no one knows who you are, I guess I'd like to think of this as some sort of metaphor. No one can tell who you are by just looking at your face, and I mean this in a more personal way, no one knows your
    birthday or your age by looking at your face, who we really are is hidden inside, which is why I felt an odd connection to this specific part of the comic.

<p>Overall I felt like I gained a lot of new information after reading through this comic. I think the one thing that stuck out to me the most was when he said "Each new medium begins its life by imitating its precedents" this is so relevant in todayâ€™s world
    and it always has been. One artist can learn from another or be inspired which creates this chain of creativity started by one person.
