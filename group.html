    <h1>MUSIC</h1>
    <p>Music is a way that many people express themselves, it's an art form. The beauty of art is that there are so many different types and you can express yourself using all of them. This photo was taken in the summer of 2017 at a Grouplove concert, Grouplove
        actually posted this photo on their social the morning after the concert and it was a huge point of happiness for me. </p>
