        <h1>MICROWAVES CAN MAKE ANYTHING</h1>
        <p>Unlike your dorm room with no kitchen, a microwave has a lot to offer. Having a microwave in your dorm room can be a complete game-changer when it comes to cooking or even heating up leftovers. From mug-cakes to scrambled eggs, a microwave can
            be used in so many different ways. The College Kitchen is here to provide all college students with different ways to utilize your dorm room microwave!.</p>

                <p2>I mentioned in my Trader Joes article that you will find so many cool and new ways to cook! One thing that I learned to do was take microwaveable rice bowls from Trader Joes and put them in tortillas to make burritos, it might sound weird
                    but it tastes good and it is a good and filling meal. The College Kitchen is all about authenticity and being unique, weâ€™re still working on finding other meals and will update this article soon with more ideas! </p2>
