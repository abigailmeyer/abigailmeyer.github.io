    <h1>MICROWAVES CAN MAKE ANYTHING</h1>
    <p>Unlike your dorm room with no kitchen, a microwave has a lot to offer. Having a microwave in your dorm room can be a complete game-changer when it comes to cooking or even heating up leftovers. From mug-cakes to scrambled eggs, a microwave can be
        used in so many different ways. The College Kitchen is here to provide all college students with different ways to utilize your dorm room microwave!.</p>
