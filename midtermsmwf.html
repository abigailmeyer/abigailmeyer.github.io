        MIDTERM IDEA: SITEMAP AND WIREFRAME
    </h1>
</head>

<body>
    <p>For my MidTerm project, I'd like to create a website for college students to look at for cooking in their dorm rooms. The reason I chose this topic is because I really struggled with figuring out how to make myself food my freshman year. Although
        I had a meal plan, I still wanted to be able to make myself food on a budget.
