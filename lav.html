    <h1>LAVENDER</h1>
    <p>Lavender flowers are known to represent purity, silence, devotion serenity, grace, and calmness. This photo was taken in Normandy, France, summer of 2018. My father was born in Verdun, France a place filled with history, after my father retired we
        spent the summer backpacking around France and came across many lavender fields. I chose to use this photo because this time in my life was very eyeopening and graceful, similar to the representation of the lavender.</p>
